I used professor's module 6 repo for the following files:
• app.js (entry point)
• surveyController.js (controller in an MVC pattern)
• data (data repertory to contain the statistics on questions, on the server side)
• fruit.json
• animal.json
• color.json
• public/assets (in order to be compatible with the instructions in the video, I used this same folder)
• action.js (jQuery code which will do the POST when the survey is submitted)
• views
• niceSurvey.html (survey, static view for the participant)
• showResults.ejs (results, dynamic view for the analysis)
• package.json (package dependency manager)
